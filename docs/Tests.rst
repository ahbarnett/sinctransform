Time and Performance Tests
=========================================

Test scripts in 1D, 2D, and 3D are included in the test directory. They compare running time of the sinc and sincsq programs to the brute force approach. In addition, accuracy is measured by the L2 error with respect to the result of the direct calculation.

To run:

.. code::
	
	make tests/test2d    
	tests/test2d 

(include some results?)
