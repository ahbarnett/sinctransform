# Sinc Transform

A C++ package for computing the fast sinc and sinc-squared transforms in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions according to the algorithm proposed by Greengard et. al. in 2006. The transforms are defined as follows:

Please see the documentation [here](http://fast-sinc-transform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation instructions, where to find example code, derivations, licenses, etc. Note also that this code crucially requires the [FINUFFT](https://github.com/ahbarnett/finufft) library. Also, matlab codes (following the same algorithm) are included as well for convenience.
